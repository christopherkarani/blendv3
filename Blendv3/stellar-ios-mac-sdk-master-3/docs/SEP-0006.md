### SEP-0006 - TransferServerService

Helps clients to interact with anchors in a standard way defined by [SEP-0006: Deposit and Withdrawal API](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md).



### Create a TransferServerService instance 

**By providing the domain hosting the stellar.toml file**

```swift
let responseEnum = await TransferServerService.forDomain(domain: "https://YOUR_DOMAIN")
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let service):
// use the service object to call operations
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```

This will automatically load and parse the stellar.toml file. It will then create the TransferServerService instance by using the transfer server url provided in the stellar.toml file. 

**Or by providing the service url**

Alternatively one can create a TransferServerService instance by providing the transfer server url directly via the constructor:

```swift
let service = TransferServerService(
    serviceAddress: "http://api.stellar-anchor.org/transfer"
)
```

### Info

This endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#info)) allows an anchor to communicate basic info about what their TRANSFER_SERVER supports to wallets and clients. With the ios sdk you can use the ```info``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the info:

```swift
let responseEnum = await service.info()
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let info):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```


### Deposit

This endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#deposit)) is used when a user sends an external token (BTC via Bitcoin, USD via bank transfer, etc...) to an address held by an anchor. With the ios sdk you can use the ```deposit``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the deposit information:

```swift
let request = DepositRequest(
    assetCode: "USD", 
    account: "GAK7I2E6PVBFF27NU5MRY6UXGDWAJT4PF2AH46NUWLFJFFVLOZIEIO4Q",
    jwt: jwtToken
)

let responseEnum = await service.deposit(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```

### Withdraw

This endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#withdraw)) is used when a user redeems an asset currently on the Stellar network for it's equivalent off-chain asset via the Anchor. For instance, a user redeeming their NGNT in exchange for fiat NGN. With the ios sdk you can use the ```withdraw``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the withdrawal information:

```swift
let request = WithdrawRequest(
    type: "bank_account", 
    assetCode: "NGNT",
    jwt: jwtToken
)

let responseEnum = await service.withdraw(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```

### Deposit-Exchange

If the anchor supports SEP-38 quotes, it can provide a deposit that makes a bridge between non-equivalent tokens by receiving, for instance BRL via bank transfer and in return sending the equivalent value (minus fees) as USDC to the user's Stellar account.

The /deposit-exchange endpoint allows a wallet to get deposit information from an anchor when the user intends to make a conversion between non-equivalent tokens. With this endpoint, described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#deposit-exchange), a user has all the information needed to initiate a deposit and it also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit via SEP-12.

```swift
let request = DepositExchangeRequest(
    destinationAsset: "USDC", 
    sourceAsset: "iso4217:BRA", 
    amount: "480", 
    account: "GDIODQRBHD32QZWTGOHO2MRZQY2TRG5KTI2NNTFYH2JDYZGMU3NJVAUI"
)

let responseEnum = await service.depositExchange(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```

### Withdraw-Exchange

If the anchor supports SEP-38 quotes, it can provide a withdraw that makes a bridge between non-equivalent tokens by receiving, for instance USDC from the Stellar network and in return sending the equivalent value (minus fees) as NGN to the user's bank account.

The /withdraw-exchange endpoint allows a wallet to get withdraw information from an anchor when the user intends to make a conversion between non-equivalent tokens. With this endpoint, a user has all the information needed to initiate a withdraw and it also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit via SEP-12.

```swift
let request = WithdrawExchangeRequest(
    sourceAsset: "USDC", 
    destinationAsset: "iso4217:NGN", 
    amount: "700", 
    type: "bank_account"
)

let responseEnum = await service.withdrawExchange(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```

### Fee

This endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#fee)) allows an anchor to report the fee that would be charged for a given deposit or withdraw operation. With the ios sdk you can use the ```fee``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the info if supported by the anchor:

```swift
let request = FeeRequest(
    operation: "deposit", 
    assetCode: "NGN", 
    amount: 123.09
)

let responseEnum = await service.fee(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```


### Transaction History

From this endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#transaction-history)) wallets can receive the status of deposits and withdrawals while they process and a history of past transactions with the anchor. With the ios sdk you can use the ```getTransactions``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the transactions:

```swift
let request = AnchorTransactionsRequest(
    assetCode: "XLM", 
    account: "GCTTGO5ABSTHABXWL2FMHPZ2XFOZDXJYJN5CKFRKXMPAAWZW3Y3JZ3JK",
    jwt: jwtToken)

let responseEnum = await service.getTransactions(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```


### Single Historical Transaction

This endpoint (described [here](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md#single-historical-transaction)) enables clients to query/validate a specific transaction at an anchor. With the ios sdk you can use the ```getTransaction``` method of your ```TransferServerService``` instance to get the data:

```swift
let request = AnchorTransactionRequest(
    id:"82fhs729f63dh0v4",
    jwt: jwtToken
)

let responseEnum = await service.getTransaction(request: request)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let response):
// success
case .failure(_):
// something went wrong
}
```
