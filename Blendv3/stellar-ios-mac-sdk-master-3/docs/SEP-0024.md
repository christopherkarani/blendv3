# SEP-0024 - InteractiveService

Helps clients to interact with anchors in a standard way defined by [SEP-0024: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md).

## Create an InteractiveService instance

**By providing the domain hosting the stellar.toml file**

```swift
let responseEnum = await InteractiveService.forDomain(domain: "https://test-anchor.com")
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let service):
    // ..
case .failure(let err):
    //..
}
```

This will automatically load and parse the stellar.toml file. It will then create the InteractiveService instance by using the transfer server sep 24 url provided in the stellar.toml file.

**Or by providing the service url**

Alternatively one can create a InteractiveService instance by providing the transfer server sep 24 url directly via the constructor:

```swift
let service = InteractiveService(serviceAddress: "http://api.stellar-anchor.org/interactive")
```

## Get Anchor Information

First, let's get the information about the anchor's support for [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md). This request doesn't require authentication, and will return generic info, such as supported currencies, and features supported by the anchor. You can get a full list of returned fields in the [SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#info).

```swift
let responseEnum = await service.info() 
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let info):
    print(info.depositAssets?.count ?? 0)
case .failure(let err):
    // ...
}
```

## Fee

If there is a fee and the fee schedule is not complex, the info response already contains the fee data for a given asset.

```swift
if let depositAssetUSD = info.depositAssets?["USD"] {
    let feeFixed = depositAssetUSD.feeFixed
    let feePercent = depositAssetUSD.feePercent
    let feeMinimum = depositAssetUSD.feeMinimum
}
```

Otherwise, one can check if the fee endpoint of the anchor is enabled and if so, request the fee from there.

```swift
if (info.feeEndpointInfo?.enabled) {
    let feeReq = Sep24FeeRequest(operation: "deposit", assetCode: "USD", amount: 10.0)
    let responseEnum = await service.fee(request: feeReq)

    switch responseEnum {
    case .success(let result):
        print(result.fee)
    case .failure(let err):
        // ..
    }
}
```

## Interactive Flows

Before getting started, make sure you have connected to the anchor and received an authentication token, by using the SDKs [WebAuthenticator](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/blob/master/README.md#8-stellar-web-authentication).
We will use the jwt token in the examples below as the SEP-10 authentication token, obtained earlier.

### Deposit
To initiate an operation, we need to know the asset code.

```swift
let req = Sep24DepositRequest(jwt: token, assetCode: "USD")
let responseEnum = await service.deposit(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.url)
case .failure(let err):
    // ..
}
```

As a result, you will get an interactive response from the anchor.
Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

```swift
let url = result.url
let id = result.id
```

### Withdraw

Similarly to the deposit flow, a basic withdrawal flow has the same method signature and response type:

```swift
let req = Sep24WithdrawRequest(jwt: token, assetCode: "USD")
let responseEnum = await service.withdraw(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.url)
case .failure(let err):
    // ..
}
```

As a result, you will get an interactive response from the anchor.
Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

```php
let url = result.url
let id = result.id
```

### Providing KYC Info
To improve the user experience, the SEP-24 standard supports passing user KYC to the anchor via [SEP-9](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0009.md).
In turn, the anchor will pre-fill this information in the interactive popup.

```swift
var req = Sep24DepositRequest(jwt: token, assetCode: "USD")
req.kycFields = [KYCAMLFieldsEnum.firstName("John"),
                    KYCAMLFieldsEnum.lastName("Doe"),
                    KYCAMLFieldsEnum.emailAddress("john.doe@gmail.com")];

let responseEnum = await service.deposit(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.url)
case .failure(let err):
    // ..
}
```

### Changing Stellar Transfer Account

By default, the Stellar transfer will be sent to the authenticated account (with a memo) that initiated the deposit.

While in most cases it's acceptable, some wallets may split their accounts. To do so, pass additional account (and optionally a memo):

```swift
var req = Sep24DepositRequest(jwt: token, assetCode: "USD")
req.account = "G..."
req.memo = "my memo"
req.memoType = "text"

let responseEnum = await service.deposit(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.url)
case .failure(let err):
    // ..
}
```
Similarly, for a withdrawal, the origin account of the Stellar transaction could be changed.


## Getting Transaction Info

On the typical flow, the wallet would get transaction data to notify users about status updates. This is done via the SEP-24 GET /transaction and GET /transactions endpoint.

```swift
let req = Sep24TransactionsRequest(jwt: token, assetCode: "ETH")
let responseEnum = await service.getTransactions(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.transactions.count)
case .failure(let err):
    // ...
}
```

Single Transaction:

```swift
var req = Sep24TransactionRequest(jwt: "test")
req.stellarTransactionId = "17a670bc424ff5ce3b386dbfaae9990b66a2a37b4fbe51547e8794962a3f9e6a"
let responseEnum = await service.getTransaction(request: req)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let result):
    print(result.transaction.id)
case .failure(let err):
    // ..
}
```
