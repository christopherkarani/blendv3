# SEP-0008 - Regulated Assets

Regulated Assets are assets that require an issuer’s approval (or a delegated third party’s approval, such as a licensed securities exchange) 
on a per-transaction basis. [SEP-08](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0008.md)
standardizes the identification of such assets as well as defines the protocol for performing compliance checks and requesting issuer approval.

## Create a `RegulatedAssetsService` instance

Let's start with creating a `RegulatedAssetsService` object, which we'll use for all SEP-08 interactions.

**Via it's constructor:**

```swift
let service = try RegulatedAssetsService(tomlData: tomlData);
```

The parameter `tomlData` of type `StellarToml` represents stellar.toml data provided by the Server (e.g. Anchor) as described in the [SEP-01 Example](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/blob/master/docs/SEP-0001.md)

**Or by providing the domain hosting the stellar.toml file**

```swift
let responseEnum = await RegulatedAssetsService.from(domain: "place.domain.com")
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let service):
    // ...
case .failure(let error):
    //...
}
```

This will automatically load and parse the `stellar.toml` file. It will then create the `RegulatedAssetsService` instance by using the needed data provided in the `stellar.toml` file by the Server.

## Get regulated assets

During initialization, the service extracts the relevant assets from the provided toml data. 
It considers only those currencies that are regulated and have an approval server set.

You can access them as follows:

```swift
let regulatedAssets = service.regulatedAssets
```

## Authorization required

By using the service, you can check if a given asset needs authorization.

```swift
let responseEnum = await service.authorizationRequired(asset: regulatedAssets.first!)
switch responseEnum {
case .success(let required):
    if (required) {
        // ...
    }
case .failure(let err):
    // ...
}
```

This loads the issuer account data from the Stellar Network and checks if the both 
flags `authRequired` and `authRevocable` are set.


## Send transaction to approval server

First let's create the transaction:

```swift
var xAsset = regulatedAssets.first!;

// Operation 1: AllowTrust op where issuer fully authorizes account A, asset X
let op1 = SetTrustlineFlagsOperation(sourceAccountId: xAsset.issuerId,
                                    asset: xAsset,
                                    trustorAccountId: accountAId,
                                    setFlags: TrustLineFlags.AUTHORIZED_FLAG,
                                    clearFlags: 0)

// Operation 2: Account A manages offer to buy asset X
let op2 = ManageBuyOfferOperation(sourceAccountId: accountAId,
                                selling: Asset(type: AssetType.ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE)!,
                                buying: xAsset,
                                amount: 10,
                                price: Price.fromString(price: "0.1"),
                                offerId: 0)

// Operation 3: AllowTrust op where issuer sets account A, asset X to AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG state
let op3 = SetTrustlineFlagsOperation(sourceAccountId: xAsset.issuerId, 
                                    asset: xAsset,
                                    trustorAccountId: accountAId,
                                    setFlags: TrustLineFlags.AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG,
                                    clearFlags: 0)

let tx = try Transaction(sourceAccount: accountA,
                        operations: [op1, op2, op3],
                        memo: Memo.none)

try tx.sign(keyPair: accountAKp, network: network)

let txBase64Xdr = try tx.encodedEnvelope()

```

Next let's send it to the approval server using our service:

```swift
let responseEnum = await service.postTransaction(txB64Xdr: txBase64Xdr, apporvalServer: xAsset.approvalServer)
switch responseEnum {
    // ...
}
```

Depending on the `responseEnum` type you can now access the corresponding data.

```swift
switch responseEnum {
     case .success(let postResponse):
        // Transaction has been approved and signed by the issuer
        print(postResponse.tx);
        print(postResponse.message);
    case .pending(let postResponse):
        // The issuer could not determine whether to approve this transaction at the moment. 
        print(postResponse.timeout);
        print(postResponse.message);
    case .revised(let postResponse):
        // Transaction has been revised to be made compliant, and signed by the issuer. 
        print(postResponse.tx);
        print(postResponse.message);      
    case .actionRequired(let postResponse):
        // Transaction requires a user action to be completed.
        print(postResponse.actionUrl);
        print(postResponse.actionMethod);
        print(postResponse.actionFields);
        print(postResponse.message);
    case .rejected(let postResponse):
        // Wallet should display the associated error message to the user.
        print(postResponse.error);
    case .failure(let err):
        // ...
}
```


### Following the Action URL

If the approval server response is `.actionRequired` and the `postResponse.actionMethod` is `POST` 
you can use the service to send the values for the requested fields. 

```swift
let responseEnum = await service.postAction(url: postResponse.actionMethod, actionFields: 
    ["email_addres" : "test@gmail.com"])

switch responseEnum {
case .done:
    // resend tx
case .nextUrl(let actionResponse):
    print(actionResponse.message);
    print(actionResponse.nextUrl);
case .failure(let err):
    // ...
}
```
